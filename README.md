The Idea:

List of Lists is a web application that allows users to curate and share lists via a clean and easily navigable interface. Instead of sorting through bar napkins, old notebooks, and random sticky notes a user can put all of these things in one place to reference later or share with friends. A user can find friends by sorting through usernames and follow by clicking the “follow” button. 

Technologies used:

-Ruby and Rails
-Ajax and JQuery
-Bootstrap, CSS and JS
-PostreSQL & Active Record
-Heroku (for deployment)
